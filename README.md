## Express Blog

- The goal of this application was to create a blog-type app in which you could create, delete, and modify posts on your account.
- The biggest challenge was getting the authentication working properly. That part took a really long time to finish and it kept breaking throughout getting other thigns to work as well.
- I used the local strategy with passport because I thought it would be the easiest to figure out.
- I used the Cirrus.CSS framework because I really like how cool and simple it looked and it was really easy to implement the things that I needed. + the documentation on it is fantastic.
- No modifications to the css were made.
- The 5 middleware packages I used were:

        body-parser: Parses incoming json objects
        passport: Authentication
        helmet: Sets HTTP headers to make the app more secure
        serve-favicon: Serves a favicon image
        connect-timeout: Sets a timeout for HTTP requests
